    <h2>Secret way for Unprivileged user to see all Corporate Card transactions through a vulnerable api.</h2>
OWASP Category: IDOR <a href="https://portswigger.net/web-security/access-control/idor">IDOR OWASP </a>
<p>There is a famous Expense reporting app for Corporates and Enterprises. It had an api
https://expense.company.com/api/v1/banks</p>
<p>that gives the list of banks associated to the particular organization. It also had a parameter called entity which was the gateway to the vulnerability that I found.</p>
<p>The typical value of the entity parameter was bank. I checked the same api with the param value card. It worked!! I successfully retried the list of card ids related to the Corporate account. Still one more way to complete the hack. We havenâ€™t seen the list of transactions for the unprivileged the user like me.</p>
<p>I completely scanned the application for the particular api. With tired less analysis and hardwork I finally found the api.
https://expense.company.com/api/v1/transactions?account_id={card_id}
It gives me the list of corporate expenses that I was not supposed to view. That left the Company transactions exposed to simple staff user. Hard work paid off in form of bounty.</p>
