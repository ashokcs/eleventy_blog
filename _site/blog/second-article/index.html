    <h2>The recent encounter was very important one and I have set a significant milestone improvement.</h2>
<p>I have successfully completed more than dozens of Performance improvement operations in my apps hosted in Cloud.
<u>Tech Spec: Java, Spring Boot, MySql, Redis, Kafka, AWS.</u>
Let me jump into the details of what I have accomplished and how.</p>
<p>The Great Issue:
Customers in an entire Data Center started facing slowness occasionally. The slowness issue started piling up over a period of time. In one fine day, all of a sudden we received lots of reports from customers.</p>
<p>Solution:
Phase #1: (Quick &amp; Immediate Solution)
To the rescue I volunteered the operation to lead and work in field. Application server logs are just fine, except some locks timeout logged here and there. I came up with the idea of increasing the lock time bit more, with below configuration.
innodb_lock_wait_timeout=500
which was 5 seconds of waiting time for the lock to release and acquire it.
Good News!! The issues was temporarily solved. I knew it was not the permanent or Optimized solution. I started digging where is the real issue lies in code. In the Purchase Order (Module A) module flow, we have an option to create payments from bulk PO (Module A). The action dries up the MySql Thread Pool high by repeatedly calling DB read operations for the same Process Order (Module B) resources.
With patience and Step by Step debugging I was able to find and reproduce the issue and I had planned for the fix. Caching to the Rescue.</p>
